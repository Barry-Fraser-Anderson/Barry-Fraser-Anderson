### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer with over 35 years of experience.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching ways to improve and automate the daily billing process at my place of work.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing my skills, particularly C#, .Net Core, React, Node.js
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to use these (and my other) skills for the aforementioned improvements.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I play table-tennis
